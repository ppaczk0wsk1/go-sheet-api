# Go Sheet API

Welcome to the only REST API held together by sheer willpower, a Google Sheet, and my irrational desire to do something in Go.

What started as “I should do something in Go” became a full-blown REST API running on Google Sheets as the backend database. No Postgres. No SQLite. Just... Sheets. The kind with rows and columns and sadness.

## Why Google Sheets?
Because I didn't want to install a database. And I love bad ideas that technically work.

- ✅ Free
- ✅ Serverless (in the worst way possible)
- ✅ Editable by non-devs (like your boss)
- ✅ Feels illegal - but isn't

## Real-Life Uses for Go Sheet DB (Weirdly Viable)
Despite being built on pure tech blasphemy, this API can work for small, chaotic, and oddly practical use cases:

- Event RSVP Tracking (Without a Real Backend)
- Internal Tools for Non-Devs
- Prototyping APIs Before You Commit to a Real DB
- Teaching & Workshops
- Collecting Feedback, Bug Reports, or Feature Votes

Stay weird.
Ship the chaos.
Go write terrible software on purpose.
